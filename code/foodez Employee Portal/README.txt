Hello Professor Marsic, Li, and Yue,

In order to run the portal, it requires WampServer. It can be found here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/wampserver/

After installing WampServer, go inside the downloaded employee portal code folder and move all of the files to this directory: C:\wamp\www

To open up the portal, run WampServer and it should show up in your Windows taskbar at the bottom right. Click the Wamp icon, and select "Put Online"

Click the Wamp icon once it has been put online, and select "Localhost" at the top and the portal should open.

Once open, you will need valid log in credentials.
