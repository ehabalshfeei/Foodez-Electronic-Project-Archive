Hello Professor Marsic, Li, and Yue,

To make use of the database files, first make sure to run through the README.txt for how to get the code and portal up and running.

Once done, be sure the WampServer has been put online, and click the Wamp icon in your Windows taskbar; select "phpMyAdmin" near the top.

At the top left (below the phpMyAdmin logo), select the parent "New"

We will create four new databases named:

"foodezwo_employees"
"foodezwo_shifts"
"foodezwo_shifts_chef"
"foodezwo_shifts_busboy"

In the tree selection interface on the left, select each of the four databases (one at a time), and run through the instructions below:

~
Click on the import button at the top of the page.

Select the "Choose File" button and find the corresponding ".sql" file from 
the extracted contents of the database files downloaded at the beginning.
For example, for the "foodezwo_employees" database, choose the "foodezwo_employees.sql" file.

Scroll down and click the GO button.
~

The databases should now be ready to go. The portal should show all relevant data and taking action in the portal should modify the database accordingly.


Thank you,
The foodez Team
